# weather dashboard

[Link to Working Application](https://nova-codes.github.io/weather-dashboard)

The goal of this website/app was to create a fully-functional weather dashboard utilizing two different OpenWeather APIs (one for current weather/forecast and another for the UV index). Upon visiting the site for the first time, all the fields will be blank and the only thing you're able to do is search for a city.
